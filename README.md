# Terminal User Interface (TUI) based Task App

This is a simple TUI app developed using [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
The main objetcive was to explore GO TUI app development and see how to manage the state and interaction of composite views in a terminal.
The app also adjust its size when user resize the terminal.

It is based on three views
- Filter > To filter Table items.
- Table > To show the tasks with pagination support.
- Details > To view the detail of a task. User can also edit the task and add a new one.
